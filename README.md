# TSP-Assignment3
This project focuses on TSP probelm using Simulated Annealing.

This study investigates the application of Simulated Annealing (SA) to address the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Leveraging the probabilistic approach of SA, the research explores its effectiveness in approximating near-optimal solutions to TSP instances. The
results reveal a delicate balance between computational cost and solution quality, underscoring the utility of the algorithm in practical optimization scenarios. Key insights include the impact of SA parameters on convergence and scalability across diverse city configura-
tions. The study suggests avenues for future research, emphasizing parameter fine-tuning and broader applications in optimization. The findings enrich the understanding of the role
of SA in tackling optimization challenges, particularly in logistics, network design, and resource allocation.
